# Discord Debugging Issue Mindmap
**Clustering threshold:** `0.885`

## Cluster 1: This is your wallet name! Sorry I missed up the emails
- This is your wallet name! Sorry I missed up the emails
- i did not see the WALLET_NAME in the email sent to me, are we still using the default one there
- Took me too long trying to figure out what was wrong. Turns out I didn't make the changes to the wallet name. Thanks @pinheadmz
- Hey @pinheadmz , I haven't received the mail with this wallet and bitcoin node config, I have attended the meeting yesterday (13th Jan 2026). Can you please help me with this ! Thanks .
- hii @pinheadmz , i received the mail welcome message from Jonas and haven't received the mail with this wallet and bitcoin node config
- hii @pinheadmz , I haven't received the mail with this wallet and bitcoin node config
- dm me with your email address
- @pinheadmz please is the wallet-name same for everyone, it was not in email, i just used the pin info i saw which is wallet_002
- https://discord.com/channels/1431021528866361438/1433469014662840421/1460379131123466302

## Cluster 2: I do hope once the hostility fades, we can push for open prompts so people stop pretending they coded things and hiding the prompts. Take all the space you need to get there and hmu if you change your mind and want to promote open source practices within ethical AI use.
- I do hope once the hostility fades, we can push for open prompts so people stop pretending they coded things and hiding the prompts. Take all the space you need to get there and hmu if you change your mind and want to promote open source practices within ethical AI use.
- Sorry I'm confused. Open prompts mean you just give credit to the LLM?
- It means you show the prompts you use to write production level software as a strict requirement of "open source".
- Ok. I don't know. Currently bitcoin core is pretty hostile to code and docs and comments written by obvious LLM bc reviewers expect the code author to know exactly what they are doing. But I suggest you reach out to some OSS Bitcoin projects and see what their policy is and tune your challenge responses to a goal of working on the space full time
- AI is still new technology, so we are right now setting the rules of how AI and OSS intersect. People will set rules in small groups like this, and if those rules help students learn, maybe they become adopted as standards of OSS more broadly. No pressure, but I really think the shame is making it harder to learn, and driving students to hide their level of competency, rather than promoting openness. Me talking to you here trying to peer pressure you to peer preure your students into "open prompt" standards, at least in education settings, is how I try to fulfill the exact advice you are giving me.
- Some context https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33662
- You could open a related issue or ask more questions on this
- Yeah idk, they seem to be discussing how to attribute AI, I'm more saying "have students show their prompts as a condition of open source AI usage and for learning purposes." No hiding it. I don't honestly expect all professionals to share their prompts, I think they probably should but its trivial to lie about. Thats why I identify shame in particular as a roadblock to progress, get them to admit it, get them to show you the prompts, get them to stop planning how to build and do more reading, analysis, going over of concepts in between planning and build steps. This way you could pin down who is leaning on the machine and who is doing deep systems analysis before they make a flow chart for their backend. Like I said, we'll all get their eventually, take your time.
- I wasn't aware of this. good discussion in the PR from both sides.
- I'm hesitant to hop in the thread and change the subject to open prompting standards before I get more feedback or even traction in educational spaces for open prompting as a way to prevent reckless AI usage and accusations about individual cases of AI usage. To me opening the prompts gets rid of all the political fighting and lets people prove if they took timeto do it right or not. I don't see another way to prove that outside of prompt sharing but I'd love to be proven wrong.
- Thank you for feedback on this, I think we've run our course and done all I can do in terms of normalizing ethical and productive behavior. Definitely not open to coercion but I would invite anyone trying to establish a difference between professional ai work and sloppy hack jobs to look to the prompts for an easy way to differentiate the two, the same way looking at open source code tells you its quality. Again, I would never tolerate coercion, but might be asked to show your work when you ask for help in order to receive help so we know we're actually helping you learn. I'd like showing your prompts to become normal practice, I think it would help close the gap between the two sides a bit but I may be alone in that here and now.

## Cluster 3: for EXTENDED_PRIVATE_KEY we are only using the value inside this tr() as sent to mail
- for EXTENDED_PRIVATE_KEY we are only using the value inside this tr() as sent to mail
- how about this @pinheadmz for EXTENDED_PRIVATE_KEY we are only using the value inside this tr() as sent to mail
- yeah that is correct, because that is how descriptors work.https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0386.mediawiki
- nobody is answering this: for EXTENDED_PRIVATE_KEY we are only using the value inside this tr() as sent to mail

## Cluster 4: @pinheadmz I am receiving the following error: "Repository Access Issue You no longer have access to your assignment repository. Contact your teacher for support " Did something change?
- @pinheadmz I am receiving the following error: "Repository Access Issue You no longer have access to your assignment repository. Contact your teacher for support " Did something change?
- Check your email buddy
- Repository Access Issue You no longer have access to your assignment repository. Contact your teacher for support I'm getting the above when I try to join the classroom
- I'm getting the same error as the person above: Repository Access Issue You no longer have access to your assignment repository. Contact your teacher for support

## Cluster 6: since you intentionally broke bitcoin core, you probably should not use that binary 😉
- since you intentionally broke bitcoin core, you probably should not use that binary 😉
- you can download from bitcoincore.org or use your own build (without intentional bugs)
- Im using the same setup after rebuilding against the copy of main branch i had.

## Cluster 7: and DO NOT post answers
- and DO NOT post answers
- Reminder: DO NOT post answers or magic words

## Cluster 8: mastering bitcoin from anton 😉 @Tigonis
- mastering bitcoin from anton 😉 @Tigonis
- i mean, i know about descriptors from mastering bitcoin

## Cluster 9: You can import your key into bitcoin core and scan the signet chain to check
- You can import your key into bitcoin core and scan the signet chain to check
- you can import your desdcriptor into bitcoin core and scan the signet chain to check

## Cluster 10: It's the same curve parameters
- It's the same curve parameters
- Yes same curve. Two different algorithms

## Cluster 11: not sure who to at so I'm goin with @pinheadmz an @satsie What gave me the most pause o this challenge was trying to figure out if I was supposed to commit my private keys hard coded into the wallet or if I should submit the entire address pool derived from my keys instead. Thanks for hearing all of our feedback.
- not sure who to at so I'm goin with @pinheadmz an @satsie What gave me the most pause o this challenge was trying to figure out if I was supposed to commit my private keys hard coded into the wallet or if I should submit the entire address pool derived from my keys instead. Thanks for hearing all of our feedback.
- wondering about this too or we can put it in env?
- You just hardcode the tprv from the mail into your balance.py. The derived keys don't need to be submitted anywhere, you just need them to sum up the wallet balance.
- Yes ofc, and i did that, but understand that it isn't normally safe right lol? If we have to create a pool of addresses to check for incoming utxos, then we can just push that list of addresses and still get the exact same results without exposing the key. Anyway, it says "Submit a program with your tprv hard-coded, execute the necessary bitcoin-cli RPCs and return your wallet balance" but that is just very counter intuitive imo. Usually something you NEVER do lol.
- The instructions say somewhere explicitly: Submit a program with your tprv hard-coded, execute the necessary bitcoin-cli RPCs and return your wallet balance. The overthinking is real.
- One other thing that's not obvious is, does the hardcoded tprv also include the descriptions at the end (/86h/1h/0h/0/*), or we have to hardcode them seperately?
- Yeah I imagine (/86h/1h/0h/0/*) probably isnt the default derivative path on normie signet but I'm not sure, you'll have to include it somewhere either way.
- alright, that makes sense. i can't seem to find any resources on how to use this derivation paths to derive the next sets of keys. does anyone have anything helpful?
- https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/keys/hd-wallets/derivation-paths/
- (/86h/1h/0h/0/*) See that star asterisk at the end?? That is the important part.
- Correct, you have to protect your keys to _funded addresses on mainnet_ at all cost. Never submit them anywhere. But the "coins" on Signet do not have any value, no incentive to steal them for anybody.
- They have value to me because if someone steals my coins I cannot complete the challenge lololol. I would be the first guy to get clipboard snooped and wallet drained while in the BOSS program.
- Yes, talk about personal attachment 😆 . The challenge though is to sum your UTXOs until block 300. They will still be present, even if someone spends them later
- its a private repo, just you and me

## Cluster 12: glad to be here, what is the task here?
- glad to be here, what is the task here?
- Were you also sent here after sending the magic word to holcat, but without giving you the link to the github repo with the challenge? lol me, too
- no, i got a message from holocat after passing the test-the-test .
- me too, but that message didn't include the link to the challenge. so here I am, not knowing what to do. Did you get the link?
- oh no! I didn't get the link too.
- What did @Holocat reply to your magic word?
- "Congrats! You passed Test the Test!" and a button that says "Join Signet Wallet: BALANCE". When I click the button, I get a link that leads to this channel.
- Okay, now you have to tell @holocat something special from the kick-off meeting.
- I just did (I had given it the magic word before so I didn't think of posting it again) and now it says I don't have access to the assignment repo anymore
- Then you should have received another message via e-mail.
- did you attend a welcome call?
- Thank youuu! I just got the e-mail and now have access to the repo!
- oh not yet, but i am joing tomorrow's.

## Cluster 13: Cool! So, in [BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#cite_ref-22-0), in the script validation rules of the script path, the following is stated: > If t ≥ 0xFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141 (order of secp256k1), fail. Which is in regard to the tweak used to generate the key. Why don't we just apply modulo? If we assume the output of a hash is random, then we should be safe.

Which is in regard to the tweak used to generate the key. Why don't we just apply modulo? If we assume the output of a hash is random, then we should be safe.
- Good crypto question. Not sure if wrapping a large tweak around modulus would work or if the BIP is specified to make things easier like batch validation
- Actually. I suggest asking this on bitcoin stack exchange. I bet you get answer from sipa in a day or less
- not sure if it is right but holocat seems to give reasonable explanation https://chat.bitcoinsearch.xyz/?author=holocat&question=So%252C%2520in%2520BIP341%252C%2520in%2520the%2520script%2520validation%2520rules%2520of%2520the%2520script%2520path%252C%2520the%2520following%2520is%2520stated%253A%250AIf%2520t%2520%25E2%2589%25A5%25200xFFFFFFFF%2520FFFFFFFF%2520FFFFFFFF%2520FFFFFFFE%2520BAAEDCE6%2520AF48A03B%2520BFD25E8C%2520D0364141%2520%28order%2520of%2520secp256k1%29%252C%2520fail.%250AWhich%2520is%2520in%2520regard%2520to%2520the%2520tweak%2520used%2520to%2520generate%2520the%2520key.%250A%250AWhy%2520don%27t%2520we%2520just%2520apply%2520modulo%253F%2520If%2520we%2520assume%2520the%2520output%2520of%2520a%2520hash%2520is%2520random%252C%2520then%2520we%2520should%2520be%2520safe.
- wait what? i thought holocat was just a discord bot
- He's a recurring character 😉
- Interesting so like the math would be correct but it might introduce a bias to the random distribution
- I understand holocat's answer, but I'm not convinced. You can also argue that excluding some tweaks based on the fact that they're above the order of the group, might introduce a bias in the tweaks.
- hmmm when i reopen holocat's answer changes so don't know if he is explaining it the same every time 😅

## Cluster 14: Are there any objections to artificially disabling the github autograder workflow while my work is incomplete? Context: I would like to push my changes intermittently, but there is no point in wasting resources on autograder if it will/should fail. I was thinking of changing the workflow file in this way: `jobs.run-autograder-tests.if: false && <current conditions>`. Is that fine or am I missing some downstream effects causing issues?

- it runs on main only, i believe. branch out and merge in when you're done
- It only runs on push to main though, not merge (I think?)
- if you merge locally then push the merge commit, that's a push
- he meant: branch out, merge back to main, then push
- Ah, that would work nicely. Thanks!
- Hi FoulMinion, if you commit, but you don't push, only your local git database is updated. You make the changes public by the "git push" command. Usually this is how most people work... commit locally, and push later. You can do some cosmetics on your local commits before pushing, if you wish.
- I prefer to have a remote copy of my work in progress, too. Using a wip branch does the trick in this case.

## Cluster 15: Hi All, I have a protocol related question. In the challange, we have to implement a function called derive_priv_child(). Due to my understanding it's defined in BIP32. Here comes my question. In the "Child key derivation (CKD) functions/ Private Parent Key" section, it says: The returned child key ki is parse256(IL) + kpar (mod n). Does it mean parse256(iL) + (kpar%n) OR (parse256(IL) + kpar) % n?

- (parse256(IL) + kpar) % n
- i'm guessing the second based on my previous readings but i'm still reading bip32 right now
- it's a fun read, hehe.
- i agree. always fun to get down to the raw implementation devoid of abstraction layers
- I struggled with this quite a bit as well. I think the parentheses around (mod n) are just wrong. @pinheadmz
- that's the notation to imply mod n over the entire equation. i def saw this when working with ecdsa signature in savingsatoshi
- Exactly, see also <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic#Basic_properties>.

## Cluster 16: if you attended a welcome call, you have a github classroom assignment link
- if you attended a welcome call, you have a github classroom assignment link
- I didn't get or see any link.
- were you in the meeting? paying attention to Jonas?
- see the announcements
- I'm not great at conversations (speaking and listening) in English.
- DM @jonas and explain, you only had to listen for one word
- Is @jonas accepting friend requests? I can't DM him.

## Cluster 17: hmm, I'm wondering what to do.. I'm a C++ professional, but I don't know Rust. What is the better strategy, learn Rust by doing the challanges and progress slower, or rewrite everything from scratch using C++? In the second case, the Rust helper framework won't be available, but the language itself won't be an issue. I see no benefit working in python.. is there anybpdy else in these shoes? My main argument supporting Rust is that I have to learn it eventually....

- IDK both rust and c++ and I opt to go for rust If you good at c++ then continue it with that itself my opinion
- I think you can rewrite it in C++
- i have the opposite question. i chose python & rust for the challege languages but seeing as most of bitcoin core is written i c++, i'm interested in learning c++ during the program. this shouldn't be tooo hard as i am already comfortable with C and have used c++ recently for some arduino work. is there a way to add c++ as a preferred laguage for future challenges?
- yes, just write the challenge in c++
- thanks for the headsup
- I would say the strategy to learn the language depends of your preferences, what suits you best... for example, I'm adopting a combo of online course + printed paper book

## Cluster 18: are we to wait for the challenge after receiving the email for invoice and private key @pinheadmz
- are we to wait for the challenge after receiving the email for invoice and private key @pinheadmz
- You'll get the challenge when you attend a welcome call
- Hi I attended the call on the 13th, but I didn't receive any challenge
- did you hear the "magic word" in the call ?
- my headphones died at the end of the call, I tried to get a wired one, but i missed the end. The word was probably said at the end... I will try to join the next one 🤣 🤦‍♂️
- just DM me a summary of what you remember from the call

## Cluster 19: Hey, check your email! You got some private data there, so make sure to use it.
- Hey, check your email! You got some private data there, so make sure to use it.
- That’s what I’m using
- your code is incorrect ?
- Everything seems okay
- of course, you **COULD** import your descriptor into bitcoin core and just ya know, see what bitcoin core thinks your balance is
- Will give that a try and see thank you

## Cluster 20: my wallet balance comes out at zero, but I don't think it should be zero?
- my wallet balance comes out at zero, but I don't think it should be zero?
- You probably missed to scan the blockchain from the block 0 to the 300th
- I did that, then I scanned them all, still zero.
- Maybe you are using the wrong wallet key and private key
- Have you replaced the value in the import descriptor command?
- I am getting a balance now - but it is not passing the test - value is incorrect...

## Cluster 21: if i had to guess (and you should still open an issue or PR, or post a question on stackexchange and wait for an answer from sipa) but my guess is that when doing crypto, if you see `mod n` at the end of a line in or out of parenthesis, its just taken for granted what that means

- This is the standard mathematical (not computer science) notation, as shown in the Wikipedia article referenced, when doing ring arithmetic.
- I agree this is most likely standard notation in mathematics, but still very counterintuitive for learners. Maybe add a little hint there for the next cohort, like there are many for other (less deceptive) pitfalls.
- I think it will be confusing when you encounter it for the first time. The challenge assumes that you have come across this notation before and thus hint should not be needed
- Hi! Here, the notation indicates that the operation is performed under modulus n. In Zn, it does not make sense to apply the modulus operation to an individual element of the field, since all elements are already defined modulo n. For example, when you see the secp256k1 curve equation (the one sent in the image), it is understood that all operations in the equation are performed modulo p. The notation used in the specification follows this same mathematical convention. In the Programming Bitcoin book, I think all ECC and HD Wallets topics are explained more clearly and in greater depth than in Mastering Bitcoin. https://digi-lib.stekom.ac.id/assets/dokumen/ebook/feb_d82be9cf1cb52e2b294a82275318a5c8235444eb_1654093256.pdf
- thank you for this. done with “mastering bitcoin” and currently working through “learning bitcoin from the command line” but i love how this book starts with the underlying mathematics used in the protocol. i will be implementing the exercises in rust as a learning path

## Cluster 22: And the code that you're using is open source?
- And the code that you're using is open source?
- And Open source means open prompt, aye?
- If you don't want to learn anything why are you here
- no I mean for tools we created. You cant hide your prompts then pretend the tool is open source.
- Not all of us are here because we are new to C or new to noderunning or new to bitcoin.

## Cluster 23: Hi, is this challenge released? I have done test-the-test (hence here), the magic word was just for the test-the-test right? Okay, found out.. just need to use the same magic word again
- Hi, is this challenge released? I have done test-the-test (hence here), the magic word was just for the test-the-test right? Okay, found out.. just need to use the same magic word again
- there is a "new" magic word jonas will reveal in the welcome call, that will get you the signet-1 challenge link
- I got on the call yesterday no program held, just few people on the call too.
- What? Then you clicked the wrong link maybe. There were 200 people there and Jonas spoke for an hour
- Waw! I try that of today again

## Cluster 24: (/86h/1h/0h/0/*) is trying to tell you that the final star asterisk symbol is a wildcard, try things like /86h/1h/0h/0/0 and /86h/1h/0h/0/1 on that website I linked and see if it gets you your addresses?
- (/86h/1h/0h/0/*) is trying to tell you that the final star asterisk symbol is a wildcard, try things like /86h/1h/0h/0/0 and /86h/1h/0h/0/1 on that website I linked and see if it gets you your addresses?
- It does display the addresses. Technically, the extended key is not even needed to generate these addresses? P.s. the extended key is always needed, the ui uses a random seed instead.
- Hey saw you DM'd me, I deleted my answer so I could DM you back, no spoilers for the others this way.
- I haven’t sent the DM yet though, I’ll try now.
- wow legacy addresses huh? what UI is that?

## Cluster 25: Any good source or examples on code for the tagged hash
- Any good source or examples on code for the tagged hash
- u can refer this bitcoinops workshop 0.3 lecture and code example only 10 minutes activity. https://bitcoinops.org/en/schnorr-taproot-workshop/
- Ok, i'll check it out, thx
- @ibearua the bitcoin optech workshop here helped me
- thank you shehu, will check that out

## Cluster 26: I'm getting the balance as 0.000
- I'm getting the balance as 0.000
- same here too and I still get 0 even after importing into Bitcoin core. I did *importdescriptors* and scanned from height 0..300, after scanning I tried to *getbalance* and it still returned 0. I'm trying different things but the weirdest part is, when I run my code. I don't get a single UTXO pubkey that matches my witness program at all.
- replace the const EXTENDED_PRIVATE_KEY: &str with the descriptor which you would have received in mail
- That's the first thing I did, I would never skip that step as that descriptor is what allows me to generate the extended private key and chaincode It's just shocking that it doesn't work
- I have not done this yet but i think the issue seems to be related to the tweak to be used. I am still reading stuff and i have a question. If the descriptor is key-path only, why does the merklee root exist in the first place? Or does it not exist?

## Cluster 27: besides that, everyone should have gotten an email with some private keys for this and future challenges
- besides that, everyone should have gotten an email with some private keys for this and future challenges
- I still haven't gotten that email with the private keys. ``` /////////////////////////////// // CHANGE THESE VALUES! / // They were emailed to you / // by an administrator / /////////////////////////////// ```
- `code`: ///////////////////////////////
//   CHANGE THESE VALUES!     /
//  They were emailed to you  /
//    by an administrator     /
///////////////////////////////
- DM me, there were some invalid email addresses
- I haven't received any email regarding prv keys I had attended the session dmed the word to holocat too Also got the github classroom link

## Cluster 28: why is tr() called tap root and not tape root
- why is tr() called tap root and not tape root
- https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/upgrades/taproot/#etymology
- devs were big fans of the band
- better taproot than calling it fancymerkel

## Cluster 29: Hi, I hope you're all doing well. Besides the study material at the beginning of this thread and the email that arrived after the meeting with the Lightning invoices, is there anything else that indicates the start of this assignment? Something like in test-the-test where there was a step-by-step guide outlining what we had to do.

## Cluster 30: Hi, I hope I'm asking this question the right way, but is there a preferred version of Bitcoin core to be run for this task? I ask, because I've been reading the bitcoin book: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook and it's on v24.0.1 (which I followed along to). Changing it won't be too big a deal, but I understand that the most recent versions of projects may not be the most stable. If there isn't a preferred version, is there a minimum?

- Yes, third edition. (2023) 😅
- Open a PR! It's on GitHub
- I plan on doing that, actually. 😅

## Cluster 32: Here's a starter file for the first part of the challenge in C++ if anyone else wants.. I implemented hex_encode and hex_decode helpers for the Outpoint serialization functions but that's about the only change different from the rust file. I used the secp256k1 already a part of test-the-test bitcoin core as well. Paste this below into your run_balance.sh, comment out the python/rust runs and then do ```sh solutions/run_balance.sh``` to run it.. your bitcoin_dir might also differ so change it accordingly lol ```# C++ # Using secp256k1 from test-the-test Bitcoin Core build BITCOIN_DIR=~/Documents/GitHub/bitcoin-core-test-the-test-REPLACE_YOUR_GITHUB_HERE/bitcoin SECP_INCLUDE="$BITCOIN_DIR/src/secp256k1/include" # Path to secp256k1 includes, resolves the secp256k1 headers SECP_LIB="$BITCOIN_DIR/build/src/secp256k1/lib" # Path to secp256k1 library, resolves libsecp256k1.a g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o ./solution/cpp/balance ./solution/cpp/balance.cpp \ -I"$SECP_INCLUDE" \ -L"$SECP_LIB" \ -lssl -lcrypto -lsecp256k1 2>&1 ./solution/cpp/balance balance```

- ok good, no problems?
- I guess people are getting an email post attending the meeting about prv key, so I never got 1
- might have ben a pinned message too

## Cluster 34: hi，I also use C++ but rarely work with autograder. I'd like to know how to troubleshoot errors with it after pushing a commit ，I'm not even sure if run_balance.sh was called.
- hi，I also use C++ but rarely work with autograder. I'd like to know how to troubleshoot errors with it after pushing a commit ，I'm not even sure if run_balance.sh was called.
- you can click the actions tab in your repo and review the output log of the autograder, it might help
- i did ,but nothing found yet, only job logs
- whats link to your repo

## Cluster 35: good day hackers how the new test going
- good day hackers how the new test going
- confusing for someone that's doing Bitcoin for the first time
- yeah even me lol just trying to keep the vibe on
- Why did I read this in Shodan's voice?

## Cluster 36: Oh yeah, re-implemented bitcoin-cli in C with no dependencies and now I am insane.

- now imagine a Flutter dev is to learn Rust and pass a challenge. Life isn't on plain grrounds
- "how does memory work aaaaaaaaah"

## Cluster 37: **important** how to check locally whether autograder will pass you,simple python3 solution/python.balance.py(the next one will anyway give you what this gives,however) bash ./.github/test/test_balance.sh cat ./.github/test/wallet_balances.txt (run only once and write it down-this is what you gotta match)

- `command`: bash ./.github/test/test_balance.sh
- The cooler way to check is import your descriptor into bitcoin core, sync the signet chain and check your balance

## Cluster 38: yeah it was like an example,on how to fix a bug even after test passes

- which becomes a reason for not accessing the next repo
- creating threads is a nice way to keep the main chat clean

## Cluster 39: so, they are all released 😉 how far are you gonna get ?
- so, they are all released 😉 how far are you gonna get ?
- are all the subsequent challenges expected to be completed by the end of month 1 (i.e 1 month from jan 12?)
- this was all addressed in the welcome call
- does it say how many challenges there are for month 1?

## Cluster 40: I saw the “Boss Program 2026: Private data for coding challenges “ in my email, am I supposed to use that for something to resolve the issue?

- look for an email from github
- it's usually the email or the cat
- Checked my email, aside from welcome message from Jonas and Private code from Matthew, can’t find any other email with GitHub link accept an invite

## Cluster 41: Make sure you're using the right bitcoin.conf
- Make sure you're using the right bitcoin.conf
- I use the one present in /config/bitcoin.conf
- You're not. Otherwise you'd be in the right network
- See the `-conf` bit in the Makefile I shared

## Cluster 42: Does anyone have a good resource I can refer to learn about descriptors? I cannot seem to get the right intro material.
- Does anyone have a good resource I can refer to learn about descriptors? I cannot seem to get the right intro material.
- Did you find the BIPs ?
- I have the 2nd edition I bought in 2021, no mention of descriptors. Cannot seem to find it in the 3rd edition as well..any specific doc in the book's github repo?
- I look for the BIPs . Thanks!

## Cluster 43: yeah, the Github Actions Test is using the wallet name to lookup the target value in test\wallet_balances.txt - the calculation was correct, just the wallet name was wrong. It passed the test now.
- yeah, the Github Actions Test is using the wallet name to lookup the target value in test\wallet_balances.txt - the calculation was correct, just the wallet name was wrong. It passed the test now.
- noted. why wallet name matters?
- @CosmopolitanApe you hand the wallet name together with the balance over to the autograder. Fails with incorrect wallet name.
- becauae the docs explictly require your code to output wallet name and balance

## Cluster 44: Why am I getting a balance locally but the autograder is falling
- Why am I getting a balance locally but the autograder is falling
- Have you changed WALLET_NAME?
- Yes to the one provided in the mail
- Link to your repo I'll take a look

## Cluster 45: I am afraid I have been asking for this email I hear people talk about ever since I attended the call but i haven't been assisted ☹️
- I am afraid I have been asking for this email I hear people talk about ever since I attended the call but i haven't been assisted ☹️

- @pinheadmz I just did, thank you
- If you use a different email on Github than what you signed up for B.O.S.S. with, the email you are looking for will be in the email associated with your Github account. It should be from "github-classroom"

## Cluster 46: Also I'm seeing this error every time I make bitcoin-cli command, it doesn't seem to matter for my API query, but I'm not quite sure ``` [error] UndoReadFromDisk: OpenUndoFile failed for FlatFilePos(nFile=-1, nPos=0)```

- `code`: [error] UndoReadFromDisk: OpenUndoFile failed for FlatFilePos(nFile=-1, nPos=0)
- Anyone else see this error or know how to handle it? I tried to remove all data in signet folder and restart node, but still end up the same.
- I think this error is because you have incorrect files in your blockchain (sudden server shutdown, lack of disk space). Reindex your blocks and see what happens.
- Actually when I run the bitcoin-cli command from terminal, it's fine(no error). I only see the error when I run from Python script, not sure if that's normal. I've removed everything and reindex, nothing helped. ``` 2026-01-16T10:42:19Z New outbound-full-relay v2 peer connected: version: 70016, blocks=865, peer=10 2026-01-16T10:42:30Z New outbound-full-relay v2 peer connected: version: 70016, blocks=865, peer=13 2026-01-16T10:42:44Z [error] UndoReadFromDisk: OpenUndoFile failed for FlatFilePos(nFile=-1, nPos=0) ```

- Hey! Recently started challenge 1 but have not received any mail with the descriptor
- Are you sure? 200 emails went on out the 12th and 50 more on the 14th. If you are sure, DM me your email address
- Just out of curiosity Adam Jonas mentioned there was a total of ~2000 applications and only ~600 (30%) where successful. How come only 250 (12.5% of the original ~2000 and ~42% of the 600) emails where sent out?
- Sorry I meant 500 emails went out on the 12th.

## Cluster 49: Hey guys this challenge requires to run a bitcoin core node or not if so can anyone guide me in how to do that? Please

- if you are still trying to run a bitcoin node, I would refer to the #test-the-test or #running-bitcoin-core channels for more help
- And i can name the wallet anything?
- the wallet name comes from the email you should receive.

## Cluster 50: you should receive an email with a descriptor for this challenge and some lightning invoice information for a future challenge. use the wallet name in the lightning invoice section. if you got the email, these instructions will make sense.

- Hi @pinheadmz , I'm getting a `Repository Access Issue` i've completed the `test-the-test` & received the signet email.
- Same issue
- I had the same issue but I got access after checking notifications, there is a "accept" button hidden there

## Cluster 54: hi, i have a silly question, what's the wallet name? on /main.rs it's a WALLET_NAME and EXTENDED_PRIVATE_KEY, is the WALLET_NAME necessary?
- hi, i have a silly question, what's the wallet name? on /main.rs it's a WALLET_NAME and EXTENDED_PRIVATE_KEY, is the WALLET_NAME necessary?
- can we add a pin message? so wallet name matters to the autograder, and it's in the invoice part
- wallet name already in pin msg

## Cluster 55: im confused by the ``` from secp256k1 import PrivateKey, PublicKey ``` in the code, but the ``` Both Python and Rust examples import bindings to libsecp256k1 which is the cryptography library used by Bitcoin Core. You MAY use this library to access constants like G or the order of the curve, but you MAY NOT use this or any other library to avoid implementing BIP32 yourself. ``` in the readme I don't see any way to get G from this python lib, are we supposed to be using the Pub/Priv key objects here, or is that "avoiding implementing BIP32"

- You can also just look up G in the literature, and define it as a constant
- look at the docs for the library, you can use it for group operations (adding points, etc)

## Cluster 56: Hello @pinheadmz , are we allow to add external crates?
- Hello @pinheadmz , are we allow to add external crates?
- Not a particular rule apparently, however it would be good if u didn't
- i thought the docs were clear about this: you can, but dont import `rust_bitcoin` and sovle the challenge in one line (hopefully thats obvious)

## Cluster 57: "Chop off the 32 checksum bits and return" What do you mean by that?
- "Chop off the 32 checksum bits and return" What do you mean by that?
- I dont know where that is written but I assume they mean that bitcoin addresses have a built in checksum and you need to remove that? Context might help
- the Base58check string you received from the email contain the checksum of the actual data in there, if you got to decode the base58 privKey to bytes you'll notice it's 82-byte long, it goes as follow: [78 bytes of extended key data][4 bytes for checksum] You need to remove those last 4-bytes corresponding the checksum and return only the raw data.

## Cluster 58: Hi how to know our solution is correct? Do we need to push into main to check?
- Hi how to know our solution is correct? Do we need to push into main to check?
- Yes, that is the easiest way. You could also find them if you look closely at how the autogradee works.
- this is a good question and it is addressed in the docs. you **CAN** import your descriptor into bitcoin core and sync the signet chain to check your work. of course you will not be able to do tha in your code submission. cc: @Toyin

## Cluster 59: We will generate a signet blockchain and host a mining node that everyone can connect to, download the chain (around 20 MB), and broadcast their completed transactions. This is a little confusing @pinheadmz I already have my `bitcoind` working. Still learning rust tho

- ok, might help to review BIP325. Signet is a special kind of test-chain where the coins have no value. (you may already be familiar with regtest and testnet) I think that answers your question but keep asking if not
- To create a block in signet, you use a special key to sign the blocks and only the BOSS staff have the key. Otherwise we'd ruin their chain's10 minute regularity and small size.

- Yes, just finished the "test the test' challenge which I got through the magic code from the call

## Cluster 68: the entire key must be mod n, right? so which is correct parse256(iL) + (kpar%n) or (parse256(IL) + kpar) % n
- the entire key must be mod n, right? so which is correct parse256(iL) + (kpar%n) or (parse256(IL) + kpar) % n
- You're absolutely right,
- I think we all agree it is the latter. But why not just write (parse256(IL) + kpar ) mod n in the assignment? Compute the sum first, then calculate mod n.

## Cluster 69: Holocat just sent me to this channel after passing the previous challenge, but didn't give me the link to the repo for this challenge. Could somebody help me out please? Thank you!
- Holocat just sent me to this channel after passing the previous challenge, but didn't give me the link to the repo for this challenge. Could somebody help me out please? Thank you!
- you gotta attend a meeting
- I attended the first call, where I got the "magic word" to join the "test the test" challenge. They said we don't need to attend other meetings after that one. Did I misunderstand and we have to attend a meeting for every challenge?

## Cluster 70: Hello. My output is indeed the name of my wallet and the balance found. But the Recover Balance test fails. After checking, I found that the balance I found is not the one expected in the wallet_balance.txt file. Maybe I'm calculating the balance wrong. So I would like to ask if there is any documentation on how to calculate the final balance of the wallet.

## Cluster 72: can I make this more clear in the future?
- can I make this more clear in the future?
- perhaps some ascii art?
- Maybe it would help to not have a default value there? So it NEEDS to be changed, else the code literally does not run or throws an error with "Did you update the value?". But I also see how it's a problem that shouldn't exist. It can also act as a good filter for people who read I guess

## Cluster 73: Is Utxo.value in sats or BTC? Wondering what is the use of `pub fn sats(btc: &Decimal) -> u64` method
- Is Utxo.value in sats or BTC? Wondering what is the use of `pub fn sats(btc: &Decimal) -> u64` method
- There is no concept of btc, only sats. Except in the GUI iirc.
- BTC is defined in `bitcoin/src/consensus/ammount.h`

- hi everyone, Is anyone having trouble using the bitcoin.conf file with bitcoind signet? I left bitcoin.conf untouched and put it in my default datadits, but when i run ./bitcoind -signet it says me peers.dat is corrupted 🙁
- this means you likely have synced to another signet before, you need to move or delete that other signet datadir first. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27494

## Cluster 97: is it safe to delete peets.dat?
- is it safe to delete peets.dat?
- yes, it will be regenerated once bitcoind is restarted. I also had similar issues and it was because I was running peers.dat from another location. Deleting it was the solution

## Cluster 98: how do we test our solution locally? I'm using rust btw
- how do we test our solution locally? I'm using rust btw
- I have not tried it yet, but the instructions suggest: `We will run your program against Bitcoin Core synced to our private signet chain but with the Bitcoin Core wallet disabled. That means that RPCs like importdescriptor will fail. You are, of course, allowed to import your descriptor into Bitcoin Core to check your own work as you develop the wallet locally.`

- btw bitcoin core has its own doc on descriptors which is nice https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md
- yeah I've always desired docs on the ways to specify.a public key. for example I've never seen anywhere that explains how to correctly make a descriptor with the xpriv checksum and path to the xpub like this `[c80b1469/44h/1h/0h]tpubDD3UwwHoNUF4F3Vi5PiUVTc3ji1uThuRfFyBexTSHoAcHuWW2z8qEE2YujegcLtgthr3wMp3ZauvNG9eT9xfJyxXCfNty8h6rDBYU8UU1qq/0/*`. you just have to kinda know or find out the hard way that that is the xpriv checksum

## Cluster 126: this is about notation in BIP32
- this is about notation in BIP32
- I see this is just copied from the BIP, but I am still wondering. Due to the standard order of operations, modulo is evaluated before addition. So why are there no brackets around the sum? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Programming_languages

## Cluster 127: since we were talking endianess, anyone know if the integer as part of the extended key is supposed to be interpreted as BE or LE?

## Cluster 128: the magic word from the call gets you the invite to signet-1 challenge
- the magic word from the call gets you the invite to signet-1 challenge
- You are right, I got confused: on the call, they gave us the magic word for the signet-1 challenge. I entered it in the chat with holocat and the reply is a message that says "access granted: head over to https://discord.com/channels/1431021528866361438/1433469014662840421". So it just sends me here, not to the repo.

## Cluster 132: I would say go over these two steps again: - child key derivation (hardened/non-hardened index, ...) - P2TR output public key derivation (tag_hash, tagged_hash, tweaked key, ...) There are many quirks where you can easily mess up your output, making all subsequent steps wrong as well

- alright, thanks. Speaking of the tagged hash, how do we determine the right string to hash? Is this just any arbitrary string or are there hints I might have missed? It seems weird that any random string will work.

## Cluster 133: However what confuses me is this "the output key should commit to an unspendable script path instead of having no script path". I am not sure how is this aligning to what Bip 386 says: """ Specifically, "If the spending conditions do not require a script path, the output key should commit to an unspendable script path instead of having no script path. This can be achieved by computing the output key point as Q = P + int(hashTapTweak(bytes(P)))G." """ there is nothing related to "unspendable script path" thing in the math ` Q = P + int(hashTapTweak(bytes(P)))G`

## Cluster 345: It took me about 3 days to write a parser for the script descriptor. I was displeased with the documentation from here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md This is how I ended up writing a grammar, and started re-explaining the components of the descriptor: https://github.com/RazorBest/bitcoin-descriptor-spec The grammar is written using Arpeggio (Python), and it also contains some semantic checks that validate the encodings and the value of the keys. If you've seen grammars before, it should be pretty easy to read, and treat the Python code as a technical documentation.
